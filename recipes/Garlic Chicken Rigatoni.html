        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package rigatoni pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon herb-infused olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup tapioca starch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped marinated artichoke hearts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Chardonnay wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded aged Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot with water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and reserve pasta water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine tapioca starch, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet until it shimmers. Add chicken pieces and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. You might be tempted to add more olive oil or butter, don't do this.</li>
            <li>Pour in reserved pasta water and add mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in white wine, cream and Cheddar cheese. Whisk until sauce is slightly thickened. Add rigatoni and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Add rigatoni and toss to combine. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
